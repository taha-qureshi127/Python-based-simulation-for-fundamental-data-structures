Developed a comprehensive Python project that simulates core data structures, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, deques, trees, graphs, and sorting algorithms. The project features a menu-driven interface to perform insertion, deletion, traversal, and search operations, making it an interactive tool for understanding data structure functionality.
